# 🌳 Decision Tree Diabetes Progression Predictor

## 📌 About
Decision Tree Regression is a non-linear model that predicts a target variable by splitting the dataset into branches based on feature values. It uses if-else rules to form a tree structure, where each leaf node represents a predicted value, making it easy to interpret and visualize.

## 📊 Dataset
We use the Diabetes dataset from `sklearn.datasets`, which contains medical details to predict disease progression.

**Features used:**
- Age (years)
- BMI (kg/m²)
- Blood Pressure (mm Hg)
- S5 Serum Measurement (lab test)
- S1 Serum Measurement (lab test)

**Target:** A quantitative measure of diabetes progression one year after baseline.
