# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Predictor (Random Forest + Flask)

This project is a web-based machine learning application that predicts whether a breast lump is **Benign** (non-cancerous) or **Malignant** (cancerous) using a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset from `scikit-learn`.

The app provides a simple, user-friendly form that only requires 6 key tumor features as input, each with example placeholder values for ease of use.

##  Features
- Predicts breast cancer diagnosis using only 6 user-input numeric features
- Random Forest Classifier trained on established dataset
- Responsive Flask web interface
- Example placeholders for user convenience

## Dataset

Uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset** from `scikit-learn`, featuring 30 computed imaging features.

**Prediction target:**
- `0` → Malignant (cancerous)
- `1` → Benign (non-cancerous)

**The web form collects these 6 features:**
- Mean Radius (e.g., 14.2)
- Mean Texture (e.g., 20.1)
- Mean Perimeter (e.g., 92.0)
- Mean Area (e.g., 654.5)
- Mean Smoothness (e.g., 0.095)
- Mean Compactness (e.g., 0.084)

_All others are set to their dataset averages to keep predictions accurate._
